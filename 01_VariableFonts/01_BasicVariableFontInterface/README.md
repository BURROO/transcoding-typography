# Basic Setup for Variable Fonts

> [!NOTE]
> This instruction is part of the Lecture on «Transcoding Typography» and serves as a first step for understanding the relationship between Formating (html), basic styling (css) and a scripting (javascript) in the context of a variable font tool.

## Task

Have a look at the files and try to understand.
If you have some experience with Variable Font and Web Development, you might already get a grasp of it, otherwise please follow the explanation and the step by step Guide below.

## Setup

Install the extension Live Server by Ritwick Dey from within VSC
– Left Sidebar, klick on the icon with the four squares (one is angled)
– Search for Live Server; it should be the first one to come up


## Step 1: Preparation

To start this Project from Scratch, follow the following steps for the initial setup:

### 1. Create a new Folder somewhere on your system 
(I have a Folder called www for all my web projects)

---
### 2. Inside the folder create the following files:

- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js


> Explaination:
>
> The **.html** file wile have all the elements we need and is the formatting language. 
We add our content, and sliders in there.
Don't worry if you don't understand all the lines, nobody is writting this from scratch.
VSC autogenerates the initial file for you, when you just type *html* on the first line > it gives you suggestions, select *html:5*
>
> The **.css** file is handling mainly the layout formst and styling
>
> The **.javascript** is responsible for the logic and scripts.

### 3. The asset Folder



Ideas for further Explorations

1. Try your own font, or download a free font, and try to use that on instead with this tool. Make sure to … 
    a) Change the font name and point to the right location in styles.css
    b) Change the axis names and the value ranges (html input fields and their id names & as well as the references in script.js)


## Step 2: Writing Code
