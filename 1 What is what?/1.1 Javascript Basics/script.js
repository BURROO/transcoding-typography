// In javascript everything we do an re-use is stored in a variable
// We can give it a name (ideally lowercase) and ther are a few rules
// – variable names can not have spaces in between
// - variable names can not start with a number
//  – variable names can not include special characters, except underline

// It is common to use camel case for variable, for separating word, like so
// myVariable > The first letter of a word is uppercase
const string = "Hello World!"

// "const" is a variable, that can not suddenly be changed.
// If we change the variable later on, we can use "let"

let afterThought = "I am not sure"

afterThought = "Actually, I am certain!"

// We can different types of data in a variable
// A "number":
const myFavoriteNumber = 7;
// A "string":
const courseName = "Transcoding Typography"
// We can also use single quotes or back ticks
const stringWithSingleQuotes = 'Transcoding Typography'
// Strings with Backticks will become helpful later on!!
const stringWithBackticks = `Transcoding Typography`
